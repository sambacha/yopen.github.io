Growth and 

## Competition

Risks Identified

    There is a risk that funds flow to competition, for example, Celsius, YFII or Harvest.Finance, if they start to offer better rates, lower risk, have better marketing, UX or UI
    Open source software can be copied and YFI can be forked
    CeFi (such as the centralised exchanges) or traditional finance (banks) could begin to offer better savings products

Why is each a risk?

    Yearn Finance aggregates capital. The less capital it holds, the less useful it is.
    With all Yearn Finance’s code and ideas out in the open, either on GitHub, discord or the governance forum there is a risk that someone or a group of people take the code and ideas and implement them more quickly or improve upon them. There are already several forks of YFI attempting to do this.
    The total market cap of digital assets on CoinGecko is under $350 billion. There are trillions of $ sitting in centralised financial institutions.

How is the risk of competition mitigated?

You can fork code but forking developers, the community, assets deposited is much more difficult. The code available is only the code that has been written so far, it does not reflect all the future plans for Yearn Finance.

Yearn Finance also has many other advantages such as the brand of being the original and the fair launch that required no outside capital.

YFII was the first fork of YFI and is targeting a different community, particularly the Asian market with most of the discourse happening in Chinese on WeChat.

Celsius is able to offer high interest rates by lending to private institutions so it has a different customer base on the lending side. The rates are also likely subsidised by the CEL tokens that it holds in the treasury.

[mention Maker oracle integration - hard to copy. Also banteg mentioned Crv private formula Yearn has access to]

Improvements being considered

Yearn Finance is leading the innovation in yield aggregation.

    The first to offer the yield aggregator product that automatically switched between the highest yielding lending protocols.
    The first to offer vaults which is now a widely copied concept
    The first to offer non-KYC insurance with yInsure
    The first to offer a tokenised savings account, yUSD, that grows at the highest yields available in DeFi

While competitors are trying to copy Yearn Finance’s current products, the focus is on how to scale.
