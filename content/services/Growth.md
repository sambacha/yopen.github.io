Approximately 68% of the yVaultrevenue is derived from the yUSDvault,
which also generates most of Yearn’stotal revenue.

## Growth and Ecosystem Health

Overall yVaultrevenue increased in Sep-20 in conjunction with the yield-farming craze that consumed much of decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Ethereum blockchain. Yearn experienced a large decrease in revenue, as this hype subsided in Oct-20.

• The yWETHvault was introduced in Sep-20 and generated a material amount of revenue for that month. This vault was quickly halted to mitigate excess risk to depositors.

• A new version will be deployed in the upcoming 2.0 release of Yearn’syVaults. •Several additional yVaults(crvRENWSBTC, bCRV, 3Crv) that utilize Curve.fi pools also contributed measurable amounts of revenue.

• The majority of revenue from yVaultswas generated from withdrawal fees from depositors. However, yVaultswill implement a new fee structure (2% AUM / 20% performance fee) for upcoming 2.0 yVaults.

## Operational Overview

Over 80% of operating expenses were due to security costs and administrative salaries necessary to support and maintain the protocol.

• Mixbyteswas engaged to conduct a smart contract audit of yInsureand certain yVaultstrategies.

• Additional audit expenses are expected to be incurred in the future in preparation for the 2.0 yVaultslaunch and other planned product offerings. •Several bug bounties were paid in Oct-20, the majority was \$58k paid to Samczsun.

• The administrative team expanded in Oct-20, and Artem received a raise to \$14.5k in Oct-20.

• Kirby and Gismarceased receiving compensation after Sep-20.

• Administrative salaries are paid in yUSD, which is converted to USD in the table on the left.
